 NSDA rules are cringe.
## Actual Rules:
Script Requirements in Main Interpretation Events (not including POI)

A cutting in each main interpretation event must be a single work of literature: one short story or one play or one novel or one or more poems. The district committee will not collect it at registration, but the original published source of any selection used in Drama, Humor, or Duo must be immediately available at the tournament as well as a complete script of the cutting used. A complete script of the cutting includes:

- A photocopy of every page from which any line of the cutting is taken; pages are to be in the order in which they are performed.

- All words used from the script should be highlighted (any words/lines not used should be left unmarked).

- Any word changes (to eliminate profane language) and/or additions (for transition) must be indicated clearly in ink.

It is the affirmative duty of each coach and each student entered in NSDA Interpretation contests to ensure that the cutting performed meets NSDA rules.
